After the kick-off I had some discussion with Jelle about what exactly we wanted to do. I at this point was still convinced of working on NeoGXP with him. We then had a talk with Bram and I came to the realization that it wasn't a good idea for me to work on that as I would just be hindering Jelle's progress as the things that I wanted to learn don't mix well with working on NeoGXP. I want to mainly focus on low-level graphical programming and software architecture and NeoGXP doesn't need low-level programming and if it does it needs to better so not written by someone with a lack of experience.
